# NSQ-slackbot
A bot for slack where people can ask stupid questions they are too embarrassed to put a name to.

This bot will take in questions from users, format them so that all questions are uniform, and ask the question on the user's behalf anonymously.

Bot should:
  Receive PMs from users containing questions that they feel too silly to ask
  Standardize the question
  Check that a possibly similar related questions has not already been asked
  Ask the question in standardized format to the appropriate channel
  Encourage answers to be submitted as part of a thread to increase searchability and reduce redundant questions
